            <p>Painting miniatures, or “minis,” for tabletop games can be intimidating, especially when looking at the work of masters. However, painting minis is fun when you get over the hurdle of wondering how to begin.</p>
            <p>Before starting to follow allow with these steps, take a look at the Tools and Tips page. Most of the tools needed to get by are standard craft tools: exacto knife, brushes, something to put the paint on. If you are just starting out, you don’t have to break the bank buy new tools. But if you are looking to get into the hobby more and are looking for more specialized tools, they can be found there.</p>

            <p>Depending on the types of minis you are creating, there are a few different steps. If you are starting from scratch, you are going to be building the mini, painting it, and then creating a base for it to stand on. Some minis, like minis from WizKids, already come built and primed.</p>
            <p>If you’re starting from sctratch, go to the Building page and begin there. If you have a mini that is already assembled and primed, then go to the Painting page and skip past the priming step.</p>
            <p>Remember, perfection isn’t the goal. The goal is to have fun.</p>
