                <h2>Step 2a:</h2>
                <p>Before you start painting the pretty colors of your mini on, you’re going to need to prime it. Primer can be paint-on or in a spray can, however it’s important you put this layer on the mini. Without it, the paint can be difficult to work with and there’s a higher chance of the paint chipping easier and faster.</p>

            <h2>As a Note:</h2>
            <p>There are many techniques whn it comes to painting: layering, wet blending, glazing. These steps are focusing just on the very basic skills of painting and not covering many of these.</p>
            <p>If you are feeling confident after following these steps, go to the Tools and Tips page for additional links to those more advantced techniquies.</p>

                <h2>Step 2b:</h2>
                <p>Take a look at the figures on your box. There are going to be specific color recommendations or just a picture of a painted mini. You can use the colors shown there, or say “to hell with it” and picking whatever colors your little heart desires. The mini is your oyster.</p>
                <p>But whatever colors you pick, you are going to want to pick at least one darker and one lighter version of those colors.</p>

                <h2>Step 2c:</h2>
                <p>After you’ve picked your paints, you’re going to take those middle shades and start your base coat. paint the skin, scales, fur--whatever--the color you want, as well as any clothes ane equipment</p>

                <p>This is what my base coat looks like. You’ll notice I didn’t paint the object in the mini’s hand. That’s because I prefer to paint those and small details last.</p>
                <p>Each person has their own preferences, so do whatever feels natural to you.</p>

                <h2>Step 2d:</h2>
                <p>Now, you can in theory leave the basecoat as it is and be done painting. However, it’s fun to add a little depth to your mini.</p>
                <p>After doing the base coat, you’re going to take your darker colors and paint in shadows.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>This is what my mini looks like after adding the darker paint. Compared to just the base coat, it’s a lot easier to make out the details around his eyes and teeth.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h2>Step 2e:</h2>
                <p>After painting the shadows, the next step is to paint the highlights. You’ll use the lightest colors, painting the parts of the mini that stick out the most, or where the light would hit first.</p>
                <p>One more advanced technique that would help with this is dry brushing. For this technique, you dab off most of the paint until the brush is mostly dry, then lightly paint over the parts of the mini that the light would hit.</p>

                <h2>Step 2f (optional):</h2>
                <p>If you waited to paint the small details like I did, this is when you would do that.</p>
                <p>This is what the final product is after painting. Now to put this mini on a base.</p>
