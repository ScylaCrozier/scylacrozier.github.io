               <h2>Step 1a:</h2> 
               <p>Opening minis like Warhammer sets can be a little overwhelming at first, and you’re not quite sure what to look at. But using the images on the front and back, you can guage how the mini is supposed to look. And more often than not, there are extra parts or slightly different ones that what’s on the box for your customization.</p>
               <p>First, begin by separating what you need for one mini from the mold set. I recommend leaving the rest attached and back in the box so that you don’t lose pieces.</p>

            <div class="content">
               <h2>Step 1b:</h2> 
               <p>The next step in the process in building the minis is to clean it up. Looking closely at the piece, you can see where they were attached to the set and see the mold lines. Using files and/or an exacto knife (careful with the sharp edge), try your best to smooth out these lines and sprues.</p>

            <div class="content">
               <h2>Step 1c:</h2> 
               <p>After you’ve cleaned up the pieces, you’ll glue then together to assemble the mini. For this, use superglue or something equivalent. Here you can customize a little, changing what the mini is holding, the positions of apendages, etc. Whatever makes you happy, go for it!</p>

        <div class="content note">
            <h2>As a note:</h2>
            <p>Some people will paint first and then glue, since sometimes it canbe difficult to reach ceartain areas with a brush after its assembled. However, this can possibly result in uneven painting or lost pieces.So I’d recommend to glue first, but it can making painting certainbuilds a little easier to wait to glue certain pieces.</p>

               <h2>Step 1d (optional):</h2> 
               <p>As you can see in the image on the left, sometimes while building the mini you will get gaps between the pieces. If you prefer to hide the gaps, you can get something called “Green Stuff.” It is a two part putty you mix together, mold into these gaps or sculpt it to form new parts for a mini. After about 12-16 hours, it hardens and you can paint over it.</p>
